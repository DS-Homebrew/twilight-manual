        nds-bootstrap is a homebrew application used by TWiLight Menu++ to load DS(i) cartridge dumps, DSiWare, and DS-mode homebrew from the Nintendo DSi / 3DS SD card.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can also be used on flashcards, however compatibility on flashcards is lower so it's primarily intended for homebrew-only flashcards and flashcards with low compatibility.

    <p>
        To see if a game is compatible with nds-bootstrap, check the compatibility list:<br><a href="https://cutt.ly/nds-compatibility">cutt.ly/nds-compatibility</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the best compatibility on flashcards, we recommend getting a DS Memory Expansion Pak.

        nds-bootstrap can use Action Replay cheats via a <code>usrcheat.dat</code> database, which needs to be in <code>sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/extras</code>. Once the database is there, you can select which cheats to use from a game's per-game settings menu in TWiLight Menu++.
    </p>

    <p>
        DeadSkullzJr's cheat database is recommended as it's the largest and most up to date:<br><a href="https://cutt.ly/DSJCheats">cutt.ly/DSJCheats</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, if you would like to make one yourself, you can use use R4CEE on a computer:<br><a href="https://cutt.ly/r4cce">cutt.ly/r4cce</a>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that nds-bootstrap's E-type cheat implementation is unstable and as a result, your code may or may not work. This is not a fault of the database, and we hope to get this issue fixed in nds-bootstrap soon.
